      <p><center>Research has shown that when a person listens to binaural beats for a recommended time, their levels of arousal change.
      Researchers believe these changes occur because the binaural beats activate specific systems within the brain. An electroencephalogram (EEG) that recorded the electrical brain activity of people listening to binaural beats showed that the effect on a person's body varied according to the frequency pattern used.
    </center></p>
    <h2><center>The four known categories of frequency pattern include:</center></h3>
    <p><ul>
    <li><strong>Delta patterns:</strong> Binaural beats in the delta pattern are set at a frequency of between 0.1 and 4 Hz,<br> which is associated with dreamless sleep.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Theta patterns:</strong> Binaural beats in the theta pattern are set at a frequency of between 4 and 8 Hz,<br> which is associated with sleep in the rapid eye movement or REM phase, meditation, and creativity.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Alpha pattern:</strong> Binaural beats in the alpha pattern are set at a frequency of between 8 and 13 Hz,<br> which may encourage relaxation.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Beta pattern:</strong> Binaural beats in the beta pattern are set at a frequency of between 14 Hz and 100 Hz,which may help promote concentration and alertness.<br> However, this frequency can also increase anxiety at the higher end of the frequency range.<br><br>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2><center>Benefits of binaural beats therapy:</center></h2>
<p><center>Binaural beats therapy is primarily used to treat anxiety and stress, although it may also improve concentration and motivation as well.<br>
  <h3><center>Potential benefits include:</center></h3>
</center><ul style="list-style-type : disk;"><strong>
  <li>reduced stress<br><br>
  <li>reduced anxiety<br><br>
  <li>increased focus<br><br>
  <li>increased concentration<br><br>
  <li>increased motivation<br><br>
  <li>increased confidence<br><br>
  <li>deeper meditation<br><br>
  <li>improved psychomotor performance and mood<br>
  </ul></strong><center>
  <p>The purpose for using binaural beats therapy may differ between people. Some people may need help <br>decreasing their anxiety, while others may want to increase their concentration or deepen their level of meditation.
  </center>
  <center><h2>How to use binaural beats</h2>
  <p>To listen to binaural beats, a person will need a pair of stereo headphones and an MP3 player or another music system.<br>
    Avoid using binaural beats therapy while undertaking tasks that require alertness and full attention, such as driving.<br></center>
    <span width="20"></span><h4 style="padding-left : 10px;">A person will need:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>15-30 minutes of listening time
      <li>a quiet and relaxing place to listen
      <li>stereo headphones because each ear hears the sounds in a different frequency
      <li>patience
    </ul><br><center>
    Therapists recommend that to get the full and maximal effect of binaural beats therapy,<br>people should practice it for 15-30 minutes every day for 30 to 45 days.
    Once an individual has completed this initial therapy, they should continue to use it regularly as part of a maintenance practice, such as meditation and yoga.<center></p>

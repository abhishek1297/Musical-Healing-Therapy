        <h2><li>Q : How are binaural beats produced?</h2>
            <strong>A :</strong> Binaural beats are created by presenting two different tones at slightly different pitches <br>(or frequencies) separately into each ear.The effect of a third frequency is produced within your brain itself.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : How to use binaural beats?</h2>
            <strong>A :</strong> Find a comfortable place free of distractions. It is important not to listen to binaural beats when you need to do something that requires your full attention like driving. Avoid any tasks that are mentally demanding because the meditative state is not conducive to quick, action-oriented critical thinking.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : What can you use binaural beats for?</h2>
            <strong>A :</strong><br>1. Enhancing your meditation practice<br>
            2. Increasing your intelligence and mental abilities<br>
            3. Stress relief<br>
        <h2><li>Q : What is Binaural?</h2>
            <strong>A :</strong> The pattern that creates a sine wave occurs in nature, in ocean waves, sound waves and light waves. A pure sine wave is identified by the human ear as a single frequency with no harmonics, but because a track of two sine waves is created, there is a subtle, recognisable harmony.<br>That is a Binuaral.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : Is using binaural beats safe?</h2>
            <strong>A : </strong> Sine waves are not dangerous, and therefore nor are binaural beats.  We hear them every day, in music and in nature. And so, the only side effects that might potentially arise from using binaural beats are those similar to those that would come from an over exposure to music.
                  <br><br>For example, if a person who doesn't like dance music listened to two hours of dance music they might develop a headache.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : How often should I use binaural beats?</h2>
            <strong>A : </strong> Use them as often as you feel like. Some companies say you MUST use their beats every day to get results; generally I find this approach to be nonsense.<br>
            Approach your binaural beats like a hobby; by all means go crazy and use them all the time if you fancy it; if not, take a break and relax. Your gains are not going to disappear overnight.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : Why do the effects wear off after a while?</h2>
            <strong>A : </strong>  If you've been using the SAME binaural beats file for a while (varies between a few weeks and months, depending on the person), then your brain may begin to become adjusted to the entrainment.
            <br><br>THIS IS A GOOD THING! It means your brain is changing!!<br>
            <br>Some people "give up" at this point. This is a bad move.<br>
            Your brain will NOT be adjusted to the new brainwave, and you will start to experience the awesome effects again.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : Why am i not getting any results?</h2>
          <strong>A : </strong> NOT POSSIBLE!<br>
          Brainwave entrainment is NOT subjective - it works on all brains, the same way.<br>
          What's happening is you're probably over-thinking when using them - and over-riding the effects.<br>
          Imagine binaural beats as a gentle flute in an orchestra. To hear it above the sounds of the other instruments, you need to de-focus and relax, and allow its melody to come through.<br><br>
          If you put binaural beats on and then start over-analysing what's happening, it's like inviting a brass band to play over the top of the flute! If you do that, it's gonna be practically impossible to hear the soft tones of the flute.
          <br><br>Become comfortable with the idea of "nothing happening".<br><br>
          Let yourself drift off - even have a little nap. Or simply breathe deeply and try to focus on that.
          <br><br>The more you try to MAKE things happen, the worse your experience will be.<br>
          Paradoxically, the less you consciously try to do, the better results you'll get.<br>
        <h2><li>Q : What's the best way to use binaural beats? </h2>
          <strong>A : </strong> There's no right answer to this, but there's a few "strategies" that you can use to get awesome results.<br>
          <br><strong>Firstly</strong>, a great way to operate is to simply relax and let your mind go wherever it wants to (see above). Just breathe deeply and "let go". Be happy. Be chilled<br>
          <br><strong>Secondly</strong>, you could try "going on a trip". Use your imagination and go wherever you want to. For example, experiment with the idea of floating out of your body; or imagine being on a beach somewhere; or even see yourself visiting a new galaxy! There's really no limit to where your mind can take you.<br>
          <br><strong>Thirdly</strong>, imagine yourself in perfect health - in fact, imagine your body and mind healing itself. This will change from person to person, but simply get a sense of "perfect health" and run with it!<br>
          <br><strong>Fourthly</strong>, visualise your perfect life, whereby you've already achieved all your goals. Not only will this feel AMAZING, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that doing this can help program your unconscious mind to go and make your dreams a reality! If you don't know how to visualise, watch this video I made.<br>
          <br><strong>Alternatively</strong>, do whatever you likeâ€¦ There's no "right or wrong way" to experience brainwave entrainment.<br>
